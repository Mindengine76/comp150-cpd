# COMP150 - Reflective Journal to Accompany My CPD Report





## Week 0

Induction Week and the Robot Olympiad

My first week, several things present themselves. My primary objective (problem) is to learn and improve. 

Therefore, the first objective is to identify which learning strategies are going to be the most successful. Second objective is a social one. Given my situation, I felt it would be better to keep relationships with my fellow students on a 'semi-professional' footing, in short be friendly but not a friend, better to not try to lead activities or conversations (where possible), but help facilitate activities and conversations within the group. In short support, supply, encourage (slowly integration).
 
Note to self: regard this first term as an experiment, it is better to know my weaknesses and fail first, so I can better learn C++ after christmas. The first week was interesting and invigorating (just what I wanted, a new challenge!! a new mountain to climb), I was impressed by the breath of the things I could learn, robotics is something I am deeply interested in, and it was a shame that there wasn't a robot guild I could join (or that it wasn't part of the course hint, hint). This would have only enhanced my interest in 
programming (and looked great on my CV!!!), plus it would have meant alternative source of social resources. Note to self, as some stage I will propose a robotics guild.


## Week 1

From Concepts to Design and Commerce, An Introduction to Python Programming and PyGame, and Computing Fundamentals

Slight confusion, as ' game development practices' was the first module, I believed that this was the focus of this term (to be honests I was hoping that the first term was going to be a gentle walk in and MORE programing focused((infact I thought it was going to be all programming)). Would have been interesting and useful to fully understand the purpose of this term. The introduction to python was great, but it felt like this was of secondary importance to the game development practices mods (yet again my mistake).

Second problem: In the first two weeks I focused too much on some of the social aspects, plus I had not full disentangled myself from my previous job, apartment and financial commitments. This delayed me from turning my full attention to the course and reviewing the course material. Working weekends is not the best idea, but bills to pay.


## Week 2

Tinkering Graphics, the Agile Philosophy, and Journal Articles in Computing

Great topic to begin with, but I did think we would be going over the basics of programming first, lists, strings, tuples etc (even if just an overview) and hope these are used in games. Slightly blind-sided by the jump into graphics tinkering but manageable. I would have like to have known that we were going to do 'graphic tinkering contracts' earlier, as it would have help me focus my study. But overall this was good. Problem: definitely coming to term with all the different platforms and the university's systems (hard to keep track of all the different assignments and tasks). Knowing about the Trello board in week one would have really helped me to manage things). Personal issues affected me more than anything this week, as I had to visit my brother(personal issues), when I really needed to use the weekend to review the course (but family first).

Would have like to have more of a overview of the structure of games, what aspects (inputs, events, sprities, rendering etc) go into the programing structure and how they relate to one another.


## Week 3

Starting my Tinkering Graphics Assignment, Pitching my First Game Concept, and Version Control

Did not read the game pitch brief, and so thought we were just pitching a game mechanic based on the tinkering graphics mods, not a high end concept game pitch, this affected my delivery. Note to self, read the brief!!

A problem that's not really a problem. Being paired with someone more experienced in programming is a bit of a double-edged sword, yes, I get to learn from their code, but because he was not based in Penryn and lived at home, pair programming was not practical on my free days. And so he ended up doing most of the coding and bring backa completed program. Also because of my social strategy (I don't want to be too dominating), I took a back seat when it came to solving the contract. This was not the best idea (but also not a terrible idea), it would have been better to have taken the driving seat and let him correct my code, my mistake. 

Time management yet again is an issue, as I came down with 'fresher flu' and was working over the weekend, major problem as I have had very little time to go over the course work and review the lessons. NOT WHAT I WANT. Feeling little like I'm playing catch up.


## Week 4

Met my Team for the Game Development Project! More Programming and Learning about Logic and Academic Writing

Good solid team, but reviewing their code and learning from it, is a slow strategy, the quicker way is to JUST DO IT, and then have them correct it. So not the best approach
there, but not without merit ( I have learnt a lot) what is done is done. I need to blend into the work flow more, the group is very capable and I am good at facilitating 
their work (organisation, mediate disputes), but I need to be doing more.

But what have I learnt in four weeks? I can manipulate (basic) graphics, know what a pixel array is and does, I know how to call surfaces and use the blit function, I 
understand how sprites are created and can create overlaying surfaces on a sprite to change it's appearance, I can import functions, load images on to a surface. 

Hey that's not bad, but a long way from where I need to be, (but all in all not bad for a novice lol). I need a more fundamental understanding of coding.......
I need to practice what I have learnt more.

## Week 5

Peer-review finished and first assignment finished! Learned more about academic writing and complexity theory

Finally finding my feet, was able to review and start focusing on the project and the two academic assignments. Feel much more settled now that I am only working sundays, 
and one assignment is out of the way. I need to run my race, not the race everyone else is running. Research and focused self-study is the key here. Feel good about my team, 
but maybe their level is too high???? I would be able to do more, if they were capable of less????

I must stop repeating that 'I want to learn from my fellow team mates', I'm sure they will get bored of it soon, need to get more involved, but the project has already moved 
along very quickly. 

By waiting and taking a 'backseat' (if that is the right word), I have placed myslef as a spectator, not a participant and now the project has nearly growing
beyond my scope or ability to contribute. Need to find a parallel position to contribute, (without disrupting the work flow), the guys are very keen to move forward and 
they have achieved so much, it seems to be unfair to slow them down. My best strategy now is to add to what they have already done, add effects on the sprites, added new 
features to the map etc. That way I can learn from their code, but also have a real contribution (wish I thought of this before).

Really enjoying researching the principles of computing assignment, I need to know more about computing in general, all its aspects and potential.

Still feel like I'm behind everyone else, what I have gained is a greater understanding of programming, not practical skills, this is due to a lack of practice. Note to self
use the next week to review everything and make sure I understand and can use it!!!!!!!!!
